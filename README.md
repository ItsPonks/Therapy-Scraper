# Therapy-Scraper
A relatively simple and easily extensible async scraper for therapy directories, built on [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) and [Beautiful Soup](https://crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup).

The included [scraper.py](scraper.py) file has example code for scraping a few different therapist directories in Maryland. The resulting CSV file for Maryland and Massachusetts are also available for viewing.

This project is designed for the Atticus Group. You may use or modify the source code in any capacity.
